# Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository contains various projects developed during my undergraduate studies in Control and Automation Engineering at CEFET-MG. These projects were created for practice and experimentation in areas like microcontrollers, sensors, and basic electronic circuits.

## Features

- Microcontroller programming (Arduino Nano, ESP32)
- Sensor data reading and processing
- Actuator control
- Serial communication
- Sound generation
- Traffic light simulation
- Display management (LCD, seven-segment)

## Getting Started

To explore the projects and solutions, follow these steps.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafaelalmeidab/arduino.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd arduino
   ```

3. Ensure the Arduino IDE is installed on your machine.

4. Open any project folder, and load the `.ino` file into the Arduino IDE.

5. Connect your microcontroller (Arduino Nano or ESP32), and upload the code.

6. Follow any additional instructions provided in the code comments.
